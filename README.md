# Scripts
A place where I dump some small scripts I wrote

## Timezoner
Script that will look through the NHL Schedule for the season and print out the top 5 teams with the most watchable games per timezone.
Watchable is definned as "the starting time is in a preset viewing window". This window is defined in the script.
